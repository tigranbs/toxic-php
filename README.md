# About
This project is currently depricated and I'm not working on it anymore.

I've tried to combine Nginx's async event loop with PHP interepreter so that you can write your PHP code using async functionality and 
use networking directly from Nginx perfromance communication without forking new process per request.

# Stage
It is currently working for specific tasks and performs 5X better than standard PHP version. But it's not working with popular frameworks or web applications
concpet of making Async PHP is not the same as making standard PHP application.

I made some modifications in PHP language it self to handle better garbage collection during clojures execution.

If you are interested in this project or want to know more just ping me, I would be happy to talk.
